# Important Notes

### Configuration
See [the resources README](https://github.com/drognisep/spring-demo-parent/blob/master/spring-crm-project/src/main/resources/README.md) and the POM.xml for information on adding your own configuration information.

This project **WILL NOT WORK** as cloned - by design - as I didn't want to expose my home DB connection details.
